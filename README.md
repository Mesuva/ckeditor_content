# ckeditor_content
A content block for concrete5 5.7, based on CKEditor

This package allows  content to be edited inline by CKEditor. 
It uses a 'Standard' build of CKEditor, but with a few extra things enabled (colours, sub/superscript, etc)

The vendor/ckeditor folder can be directly replaced with a build/configuration of the editor of your preference.
Builds of CKEditor can be customised and downloaded at http://ckeditor.com/download

**Please note** - although this block functions well, it DOES NOT currently include integration with concrete5's file manage and sitemap. It is therefore either a starting point for further development or useful as way to handle specific kinds of content/formatting.

# ckeditor_content
A content block for concrete5 5.7, based on CKEditor

This package allows some content to be edited inline by CKEditor. 
It uses a 'Standard' build of CKEditor, but with a few extra things enabled (colours, sub/superscript, etc)

The vendor/ckeditor folder can be directly replaced with a  configuration of the editor of your preference.

**Please note** - although this block functions fine, it DOES NOT currently include integration with concrete5's file manage and sitemap.
